# Optical Coherent Tomography

- Transverse resolution: NA of imaging optics
- Axial resolution: coherence length (time of flight)

## Coherence Length
Defined as the spatial extent along the propagation direction over which the electric field if substantially correlated (You add up complex field instead of intensity of light)

$$
l_c = \frac{4ln2}{\pi}\frac{\lambda _0^2}{\Delta \lambda}
$$


## Time-domain OCT
It uses a low temporal coherent but high spatial coherent light source.
$$
I = exp(-16(ln2)(\frac{\Delta l}{l_c})^2) cos(2k\Delta l)
$$



## Fourier-domain OCT
Reference mirror stays static. Faster data acquisition. But it requires hyper-spectrum detection.
