Notes","keywords":"","body":"Gitbook Notes\nPrevisouly I have been using gitbook.com to take down notes. It's pretty convenient to have a notebook that renders into webpage so that I could take a look using browser on whatever device and wherever I work. But I cannot find a way to export the markdown files to my local machine. This could be annoying since one advantage of markdown-based notebook is that you can easily publish your written note on other platforms as long as they support markdown. So I tried to pick up the old version of gitbook-cli (they don't maintain it since 2018). The general pipeline of a online notebook will be: 1. Edit markdown files locally (e.g. VSCode + Markdown Preview Enhanced plugin) 2. Build the book using gitbook-cli 3. Commit the files to Github.com 4. Synchronize the gitbook page with the github repository 5. (optinal) Edit on gitbook.com and sync the github repository with it\nInstall gitbook locally\nGitbook is based on Note.js, so we first install Node.js v12.18.1. And then install gitbook-cli by running in the cmd terminal:\nnpm install -g gitbook-cli@2.1.2 --global\nNote npm could be installed duing Node.js installation (check that option). The latest version of Node.js and gitbook-cli might not work and errors would raise when running gitbook. I got the following error on \"data\" argument, error on pipesCount and error on graceful-fs. After adjusting package versions following these references, I managed to get it to work.\nInitize the (note)book\nCreate the notebook folder. Navigate the cmd terminal to this folder and run\ngitbook init\nYou will get two markdown templates SUMMARY.md and README.md. The SUMMARY.md is the table of content of the notebook. Open it and put something like:\n# Table of contents\n\n* [Introduction](README.md)\n* [Gitbook Notes](gitbook.md)\n* [Git Notes](git.md)\n* [C++ Notes](cpp/README.md)\n  * [Standard Library](cpp/std.md)\n  * [Algorithms](cpp/alg.md)\nThere are some files and folders here we have not create yet. But once you run\ngitbook build\ngitbook will automatically create them for you. If you use gitbook serve, you can also render them into html on your localhost so you can check your book. Pretty easy!\nCommit to github.com and Sync the gitbook.com\nCreate the repository on your github account and push the local notebook files to it. And go to your gitbook account. On your gitbook you can open a space (I think they call it space instead of book now). In the Integrations tab we can choose to integrate with GitHub. Follow the instruction and choose the correct repository. Done.\nUpdate the notebook\nWe can always edit/create files locally and upload to GitHub. Gitbook will automatically synchronize with it. But it's also possible that we make changes on Gitbook using its online editor. Gitbook will also make commits to the Github repository. Remember to pull the repo locally before editting in such case. Lastly, we can put the notebook files any server we want, including Github pages. And the notebook is neat!\n"},"git.html":{"url":"git.html","title":"Git Notes","keywords":"","body":"Git Notes\nLocal repository management\nInitialize a blank git repository in the current path.\ngit init\n\nCheck the current git repo for modified, added, removed files.\ngit status\n\nAdd or remove files to the tracking system.\ngit add /src \ngit add /src/model.py\ngit rm /src/model.py\ngit add -A  // add all the untracked files\n\nCommit with the message(-m) 'add model.py'.\ngit commit -m 'add model.py'\n\nShow the history of the committed versions.\ngit log\n\nCreate a .gitignore file to manage which files to and not to track\ntouch .gitignore\n\nInside the .gitignore file, the syntax is:\n# this is comment\n# not to track\n*.tif\n*.csv\n/data\n\n# to track track.csv : using ! to exclude\n!track.csv\n\n# the git will stop tracking the csv files except track.csv\n\nCreate a .gitkeep  inside one folder to keep blank folder in the repo.\ntouch ./.gitkeep\n\nGo to a certain commit.\ngit reset --hard da4b54\n\nHere the da4b54 is the target commit id.

The master branch is the main code of the project, and every team member should pull the code to their local machine and start working on their own branch. When submitting the code, they only submit to their own branch on the Github, NOT the master branch. Next, they create a pull request on Github and let the other team member review it. And finally, their code will be merged into the master branch. \n1.a Create a repository\nOn the github.com, create the repository. \nOn the local machine, initialize the repository in the source folder:\ngit init\ngit add . \ngit commit -m \"init the repo\"\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:aaronzq/git_exercise.git\ngit push -u origin master\n\n1.b Clone an existing repository (e.g. created by your teammate)\nLook for the link on github.com and open git on your local folder\ngit clone git@github.com:aaronzq/git_exercise.git\n\n2. Create your own branch and start editing the code in your own branch\ngit checkout -b feature/fuzeyu/new  // -b means create and go to this branch\n\n// edit some codes\n\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"add codes\"\n\nNow supposing you are not satisfied with your commit, you can reset to a previous commit in two ways:\ngit reset 01f1e // the id at the end can be looked up from git log\n\n                // in this reset mode, you move the head to a previous commit, \n                // but the changes\n                // you made will remain there\n\ngit reset --hard 01f1e\n                // no change will remain\n\nIf you are ready to submit your code to the remote repository on Github, there are also two ways to push:\ngit push origin feature/zawang // in this mode you can only fast-forward\n                               // only able to add non-conflict content\n\ngit push -f origin feature/zqwang // force to push, erase the commit history \n                               // on github branch and replace it with your local\n                               // ones\n\nSome functions that might be useful:\ngit branch // check how many branches your have and which branch you are at \ngit checkout master // go to branch: master\n\n3. create pull request on Github\nIf there are no conflicts (where part of your codes is different from existing commits in the master branch), then merge the pull request and you are good to go.\nIf there are conflicts, first you should pull the updated master branch to your local. Then, you should solve the conflict locally, using git rebase.\nmaster: A-B-Cyour branch: A-B-DAfter rebase,master: A-B-Cyour branch: A-B-C, and waiting for you to solve the conflicts in your editor\ngit rebase master // you are currently at your own branch, and you are rebase against\n                  // the master branch\n\nAfter you manually solve all the conflicts, save the files. \ngit add .\ngit rebase --continue\ngit push origin feature/zqwang\n\nAnd now your branch will be A-B-C-D.

What does this concept refer to?http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/#:~:text=Iterator%20definitions,dereference%20(%20*%20)%20operators).%20operators).)\nAn iterator is any object that, pointing to some element in a range of elements (such as an array or a container), has the ability to iterate through the elements of that range using a set of operators (with at least the increment (++) and dereference (*) operators).\\\n\\\nThe most obvious form of iterator is a pointer: A pointer can point to elements in an array, and can iterate through them using the increment operator (++). But other kinds of iterators are possible. For example, each container type (such as a list) has a specific iterator type designed to iterate through its elements.\nSimilar to pointer, a 'constant iterator' means the object this iterator points to cannot be modified.\nVector (C++ STL)\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vector-in-cpp-stl/\nIn c++ standard libirary there's \\ which defines vector. It's same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. \nEnum\nEnumeration type. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum\nUnscoped enumeration\n// syntax\nenum name { enumerator = constexpr , enumerator = constexpr , ... }\n// underlying type is an implementation-defined integral type\n// int or unsigned int\n\n\nenum name : type { enumerator = constexpr , enumerator = constexpr , ... }    \n\n\n//e.g.\n\nenum Buffer { Color = 1, Depth = 2};\n\nScoped enumeration\n// syntax\nenum struct|class name { enumerator = constexpr , enumerator = constexpr , ... }\n\nenum struct|class name : type { enumerator = constexpr , enumerator = constexpr , ... }    \n\n\n//e.g.\n\nenum class Buffer\n{\n    Color = 1,\n    Depth = 2\n};\n\nargc and argv[]\nTo run program in command line and to give arguments.\\\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-c-cpp/\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n\n}\n\n// or \n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n    cout = 4)\n    {\n        arg1 = std::stof(argv[1]);\n        arg2 = std::stoi(argv[2]);\n        arg3 = std::string(argv[3]);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // return 0;\n    }\n\n\n\n    return 0; \n}\n\n// in cmd\n// ./xxx var1 var2 var3\n\nargc : int, number of arguments input in the cmd.

But it actually contains 2 steps:\n\nCompile Use a C++ compiler to go through each of your source code (.cpp) file, check compilation error, and translate that into machine language called an object file. (.o  / .obj).  \nLink Use a linker to take all the object files generated by the compiler and combine them into a single executable program, also to link it to library files. \n\nIn order to direct the compiler and linker to correct necessary files, we will need to pay attention to 2 categories:\n\nInclude path: we should specify where to look for our header files (#include )\nLibrary path: specify the corresponding library files (.lib .dll for windows, .so .o .a for linux)\n\nWhat is library and how to use them?\nIntroduction to library can be found in the link. \nWe don't need to care about standard library as the compiler and linker automatically connect to them. For external libraries like OpenCV, by following their installation instruction, we will eventually have a locally built or pre-built library files.\nOn Windows, we usually should first direct the linker to the .lib files and then copy the .dll files to locations where the linker can search for, like /System, /System32 and directories in the PATH environment variable. Or simply, copy the .dll files to your source files folder to package with them together. https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a2-using-libraries-with-visual-studio-2005-express/\nhttps://blog.csdn.net/yefcion/article/details/80632301 (This one goes through how to install opencv for visual studio 2017. Note that by adding \\build\\bin to the PATH environment variable it enables the linker to find the .dll files. And in my practice, it also works if I bypass the environment variable editing and directly move the needed .dll to /system folder. Also pay attention to the difference between opencv_worldxxxd.lib and opencv_worldxxx.lib . Use the right one based on your build mode: debug or release )\nOn Linux, things are easier. Usually there's a make install at the end of your package installation. This will simply copy the library files to default folder in the system the compiler and linker knows.

For the input in our PSF calculation experiment, we set the mid of the FOV as 1 and the rest of pixels as 0. For the final image on the sensor, we take the square of the amplitude, i.e. the absolute value of the wavefront.\nWe call it incoherent imaging system. But we actually didn't introduce any incoherent factors. Is it correct?\nThis only works when we compute PSF, which is one single point in the object space, because a single point has no coherence concept: you can set any phase to it, and there's no second point to study their correlation. But this will not work (at least not work 'theoretically correctly') in multiple objects, such as the background.\nLet's assume we have a system consisting of an Objective and a microlens array behind the Objective. How to simulate an uniform background? If we have a constant value (constant amplitude and 0 phase term) for the entire FOV, the frequency component of this constant value will be concentuated at the center of the aperture plane. But unfortunately, let's say we don't have a lenslet at the center aperture and therefore this component is completely lost after the microlens array.\nThis is not the case in real experiment. In incoherent light field imaging, the background will still pass the system, which indicates the input wavefront is not simply a plane wave with identical amplitude and phase. If they are illuminated by an incoherent light source, they should have uncorrelated phase component: we should generate random phase for each point at different position. Repeat this for hundreds times (the more, the better) and add them up to simulate incoherent imaging.\nThis is especially true in full field OCT-LIFT simulaiton. For the wavefront from reference arm, we should not simply set it to be a planar wave. In real system we use a wide-band LED light source. And for each position in the FOV, there are no correlation in the phase (while the intensity can be assumed to be uniform).\nSome notes about coherence\nSpatial coherent: The extent of distance (usually talking about two points on one plane) that the wavefronts at two places are correlated. In most case, if we say the illumination is spatially coherent, the illumination light can be converged into an ideal point. For example, the light filtered by a pinhole can be a spatially-coherent light. Imaging system like scanning-based OCT (rather than full field OCT) and confocal microscope should use spatially-coherent light source.\np.s. To use a lens to focus a light bulb cannot generate spatially-coherent light because the smallest size of the focused light is larger than the image of the light bulb.\nTemporally coherent: The extent of time (or propagation distance) that the wavefronts are correlated. This is the coherence related to the spectral width of light. White light has very low temporally coherence and thus short coherent length. Therefore it provides the Fourier OCT system the ability of optical sectioning.\n"},"optics/simu-microscope.html":{"url":"optics/simu-microscope.html","title":"[Simulation] A microscope","keywords":"","body":"[Simulation] A microscope\nI start from simple model, a microscope consisting of one infinity-corrected Objective and one tube lens, to validate the accuracy of the numerical model. In microscope usage, sample is placed at the fore-focal plane of the Objective. An \"infinity space\" of parallel light is created between the Objective and the tube lens, which brings the advantages over the non-corrected Objectives such as the flexibility of installing filters, modulators in the middle. A tube lens is designed for the Objectives of each specific manufactuer. It collects the light and forms the image at the rear-focal plane. The pupil distance is the optimal distance between the tube lens and the entrance pupil of the objective, which is a range. But here I just treat it as a 4f system where the rear-focal plane of the Objective coincides with the fore-focal plane of the tube lens. \nSome theories\n1.

This criterion indicates that large sampling number, finer sampling step size should be used to simulate small F number lens.\nLet's consider how wavefront propagates to the rear-focal plane after a single lens.\nIf the wavefront right before the lens is $E_1(x_1, y_1)$, the wavefront at the back-focal plane via Fresnel propagation can be computed as\nE2(x2,y2)=exp(ikf)iλfexp(ik2f(x22+y22))F(E1(x1,y1)exp(−iπλf(x12+y12))exp(ik2f(x12+y12)))u=x2λf,v=y2λf\r\nE_2(x_2,y_2)= \\frac{exp(ikf )}{i\\lambda f}exp(\\frac{ik}{2f}(x_2^2+y_2^2))\\mathscr{F}(   E_1(x_1,y_1) exp(\\frac{-i\\pi}{\\lambda f}(x_1^2+y_1^2)) exp(\\frac{ik}{2f}(x_1^2+y_1^2)))_{u=\\frac{x_2 }{\\lambda f},v=\\frac{y_2 }{\\lambda f}}\r\nE​2​​(x​2​​,y​2​​)=​iλf​​exp(ikf)​​exp(​2f​​ik​​(x​2​2​​+y​2​2​​))F(E​1​​(x​1​​,y​1​​)exp(​λf​​−iπ​​(x​1​2​​+y​1​2​​))exp(​2f​​ik​​(x​1​2​​+y​1​2​​)))​u=​λf​​x​2​​​​,v=​λf​​y​2​​​​​​\n=exp(ikf)iλfexp(ik2f(x22+y22))F(E1(x1,y1))u=x2λf,v=y2λf\r\n= \\frac{exp(ikf )}{i\\lambda f}exp(\\frac{ik}{2f}(x_2^2+y_2^2))\\mathscr{F}(   E_1(x_1,y_1) )_{u=\\frac{x_2 }{\\lambda f},v=\\frac{y_2 }{\\lambda f}}\r\n=​iλf​​exp(ikf)​​exp(​2f​​ik​​(x​2​2​​+y​2​2​​))F(E​1​​(x​1​​,y​1​​))​u=​λf​​x​2​​​​,v=​λf​​y​2​​​​​​\nThis is exactly the Fraunhofer diffraction and simply a fourier transform if we don't consider the extra phase term.\nNow we want to extend the starting point of propagation from right before the lens to the fore-focal plane of the Objective. Instead of applying another Fresnel propagation, we consider what the difference is between two wavefronts at two planes in frequency domain. We know that light with a certain spatial frequency $(u,v)$ means the planar wave that travels at a certain direction. The spatial frequencies of this plane wave in three axis are $(\\frac{cos(\\theta_x)}{\\lambda}, \\frac{cos(\\theta_y)}{\\lambda}, \\frac{cos(\\theta_z)}{\\lambda})$, while $cos(\\theta_x)^2+cos(\\theta_y)^2+cos(\\theta_z)^2 = 1$ and $\\theta$ is the angle between the propagation direction and the corresponding axis. For a certain plane wave, the phase change after propagation in the optical axis at a distance z is $i2\\pi z \\frac{cos(\\theta_z)}{\\lambda}  =  i2\\pi z \\sqrt{ \\frac{ 1-(cos(\\theta_x)^2 - cos(\\theta_y)^2)}{\\lambda^2 }}$. If we relate this physically defined spatial frequency $(\\frac{cos(\\theta_x)}{\\lambda}, \\frac{cos(\\theta_y)}{\\lambda}, \\frac{cos(\\theta_z)}{\\lambda})$ to the one we computed through FFT, $(u,v)$. The phase change can be expressed as $i2\\pi z \\sqrt{1-u^2 - v^2)} = i2\\pi z \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} -(\\frac{x}{\\lambda f})^2 - (\\frac{y}{\\lambda f})^2)}$. Under paraxial approximation (i.e. $x \np.s. Another perspective from geometric optics: $cos(\\theta_z) = 1-sin(\\theta_z)^2\\approx 1 - tan(\\theta_z)^2 = 1 - \\frac{x^2+y^2}{f^2}$, where $(x,y)$ is the spatial coordiante at the fourier plane (rear-focal plane). Here we consider the chief ray that passes through the center of the lens.\nThis indicates that, if we look at the wavefront at the fore-focal plane ($z=f$) $E_0$ and the wavefront right before the lens $E_1$, they have a relation that $\\mathscr{F}(E_1)=\\mathscr{F}(E_0)exp(-i\\frac{k}{2f}*(x^2+y^2))$, where $(x,y)$ is the spatial coordiante at the fourier plane (rear-focal plane).\nLet's input this into the equation we derived for wavefront propagation from right before the lens to the rear-focal plane. We will get:\nE2=exp(ikf)iλfF(E1(x1,y1))u=x2λf,v=y2λf\r\nE_2 = \\frac{exp(ikf )}{i\\lambda f}\\mathscr{F}(   E_1(x_1,y_1) )_{u=\\frac{x_2 }{\\lambda f},v=\\frac{y_2 }{\\lambda f}}\r\nE​2​​=​iλf​​exp(ikf)​​F(E​1​​(x​1​​,y​1​​))​u=​λf​​x​2​​​​,v=​λf​​y​2​​​​​​\nIt means that the rear-focal plane is exactly the fourier tranform of the wavefront at the fore-focal plane. This is the modulation of a lens. Note that we didn't consider any finite aperture in this derivation. One can insert the aperture function $Aperture(x, y)$ to the above equations.\nfunction [f2, dx2, x2] = lenFT2d(f1, dx1, flens, lambda)\n% assuming dx1=dy1, Nx=Ny\n\nk = 2*pi/lambda;\n[~, N] = size(f1);\n\ndx2 = lambda*flens/dx1/N;\nx2 = dx2*[ ceil(-N/2):ceil(N/2)-1 ];\n[X2, Y2] = meshgrid(x2, x2);\n\n\nKoi = -1i*exp(1i*k*flens)/(lambda*flens);\nf2 = Koi .* ifftshift(fft2(fftshift(f1))) * dx1^2;\n\nend\n4.
